//! # The `pEOS-on-ETH` pToken Core
//!
//! Here lies the functionality required for the cross-chain conversions between
//! native EOS tokens and ETH ERC777 pToken equivalents. This core consists of two
//! light clients that manage the state of the two chains, along with the creation
//! and signing of transactions related to each chain.
//!
//! __NOTE:__ All `debug_` prefixed functions can only be used if the core is
//! built with the `debug` feaure flag enabled in the `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! ```no_compile
//! ptokens_core = { version = "1.0.0", features = ["debug"] }
//! ```
